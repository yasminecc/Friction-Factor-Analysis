# Friction Factor Analysis in Pipes using MATLAB

This MATLAB project calculates the friction factor for flow through pipes using two methods:
- Analytical (explicit equation)
- Numerical (bisection method based on Colebrook equation)

It also generates plots to visualize how the friction factor varies with:
- Conduit Diameter
- Pipe Roughness
- Fluid Density
- Dynamic Viscosity

## 📂 Files

- `menu.m`: Main script with interactive menu and plotting
- `Re.m`: Function to calculate Reynolds number
- `report.docx`: Algorithm design, test cases, and explanation

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Open MATLAB and run:

```matlab
menu
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter fluid properties and plot graphs.

---

## 📊 Output

Each plot is saved as a `.png` image (e.g., `pipe_roughness.png`, `dynamic_viscosity.png`, etc.).
